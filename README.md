# NL_Ling_Periodicals
Welcome to the Linguistic Periodicals Text Processing repository! This repository contains Python scripts and tools for processing digitized text data of linguistic periodicals:󰡔Hangul󰡕, 󰡔JeongUm󰡕, 󰡔Wolgan Joseoneo󰡕  which were provided by the Korea National Library. Our goal is to make it easier for researchers, linguists, and enthusiasts to analyze and work with these valuable texts.

# Features

However, the full digitized contents are not released in this repository due to the license.  Please ask rink@korea.kr (국립중앙도서관 연구정보실). 
Just to get easily going in utilizing this resource, a few sample text files are included. 


## Text Analysis
