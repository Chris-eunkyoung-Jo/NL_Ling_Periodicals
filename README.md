# NL_Ling_Periodicals
Welcome to the Linguistic Periodicals Text Processing repository! This repository contains Python scripts and tools for processing digitized text data of linguistic periodicals:󰡔Hangul󰡕, 󰡔JeongUm󰡕, 󰡔Wolgan Joseoneo󰡕  which were provided by the Korea National Library. Our goal is to make it easier for researchers, linguists, and enthusiasts to analyze and work with these valuable texts.

# Features
## Text Cleaning and Preprocessing: 
Scripts to clean and preprocess the digitized texts such as making directories for each periodical and converting Hanja(sino-Korean character) to Hangul(Korean character)

## Text Analysis 
Functions for text analysis such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.

## Topic modelling and the Visualization: 
Tools for visualizing linguistic data, including frequency distributions, word clouds, and co-occurrence networks.
Metadata Handling: Utilities for processing and organizing metadata associated with the periodicals.
Sample Datasets: Example datasets from the Korea National Library for testing and demonstration purposes.
